CAPSTONE PROJECT

### Estimation of Insurance Cost in Health Care 

For estimating insurance costs, the project analyzes the different parameters related to a person's health and habits for developing recommendations to optimize these parameters. In the analysis, both customer and company perceptions have been considered. Customers will know which attributes increase insurance costs, and companies can encourage them to claim less insurance.  Feature engineering, Feature analysis, and visualization tools have be applied together in order to determine feature importance. 

Skills and Tools
Random Forest, Machine Learning, Linear Regression, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis
